# Pokedex

My Personal Pokedex is an assignment that draws the knowledge of Javascript Object-Oriented Programming, Ajax calls, and acessing an API and displaying the information in an organized manner. 

The goal was to create a website that displayed 3 selected Pokemon from the Pokemon API and display them in a Pokedex.
